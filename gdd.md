##### Roarke Game Design Document

### Project Description
A hardcore tactical action game where the primary goal is to use Roarke's dashing slash to cut your way through levels as quickly and efficiently as possible.

### Characters
Roarke - The protagonist. A bodyguard/enforcer with a passion and talent for fencing and swordsmanship. 
Born a half-orc in the Western Continent, he's made a name for himself for being mindful, strong, and skilled as a warrior and a bodyguard. He lives in a rough part of town (where most orcs live, due to functionally being lower class citizens and just generally out of their element compared to their brethren who were born and raised in their ancestral lands on the Eastern continent.) 
He's one of the highest ranking students in his master's style, The Stormsword.
Lost his arm going above and beyond on a job and recieved an advanced cybernetic arm to replace it as thanks from his client.
Also a passionate student of philosophy and art. Despite being externally rough around the edges and hardened, he possesses hidden depths from growing up with a foot in both the world of humans and orcs, and developed complexes due to being alienated by both groups for being 'different'.

### Story 
Roarke's orcish swordmaster is murdered in what APPEARS to be a hate crime. 
Roarke is devastated and uses his skills as an enforcer to find the truth and avenge the master.
Becomes a folk hero and savior of O Sector in the process despite his inital reasons and motivation.
