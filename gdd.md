##### Roarke Game Design Document

### Project Description
A hardcore tactical action game where the primary goal is to use Roarke's dashing slash to cut your way through levels as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## Characters
#### Roarke 'Windscar'
- The protagonist. A bodyguard/enforcer with a passion and talent for fencing and swordsmanship. 
- Born a half-orc in the Western Continent, he's made a name for himself for being mindful, strong, and skilled as a warrior and a bodyguard. He lives in a rough part of town (where most orcs live, due to functionally being lower class citizens and just generally out of their element compared to their brethren who were born and raised in their ancestral lands on the Eastern continent.) 
- He's one of the highest ranking students in his master's style, The Stormsword. Earned the title of 'Windscar' in his Adept exam.
- Lost his arm going above and beyond on a job and recieved an advanced cybernetic arm to replace it as thanks from his boss. Prefers wielding his sword with his natural arm to better channel his spiritual energy through it.
- Also a passionate student of philosophy and art. Despite being externally rough around the edges and hardened, he possesses hidden depths from growing up with a foot in both the world of humans and orcs, and developed complexes due to being alienated by both groups for being 'different'.

#### Harry 'Typhoon'
- Old, wise, and a full blown orc.
- Came to this continent with his family when he was a boy when the Homeland was embroiled in a full on civil war. 
- His parents believed the war and it's reasons for existing were dishonorable and so fled while there was still a chance.
- Took an interest in a young Roarke when he noticed the child had an imagination and an appreciation for art and aesthetics.
- Taught him the sword because he believed he'd do something good and beautiful with it.
- Earned the title 'Typhoon' when he ascended to Adept-class in the Stormsword-style, and held on to it instead of taking on a new name upon reaching Master-class. He says it was out of humility, to remember that he is but a student. In reality he just thought it made for a badass name. Everyone knows it but doesn't say anything. His humor and zest for life is appreciated by his students. 

#### Roarke's Boss (to be named)

### Story 
Roarke's orcish swordmaster is murdered in what APPEARS to be a hate crime. 
Roarke is devastated and uses his skills as an enforcer to find the truth and avenge the master.
Becomes a folk hero and savior of O Sector in the process despite his inital reasons and motivation.
Almost singlehandedly changes perception of orcish in the eyes of the West through his actions and the movement he starts.
(I may make this more simple. I dunno.)

### Theme
The Hero's Journey
Striving for Excellence/Mastery/Perfection
Flow
Liberation (in the literal and spiritual sense)
Acceptance (of self, and by society)
The meaning of a Champion

### Story Progression
The game starts right in the action. 

#### Departure:
Introduction Phase:
Level 1: Same Shit, Different Day - Roarke is working a job for his client when a rival group of gangsters shows up and attacks the compound. Roarke puts them all down.
Level 2: Windscar - Roarke practices his skills at his master's dojos against his fellow disciples in an all vs one battle. He's promoted to the next rank and is given the title, 'Windscar' to befit his new rank. That night, his Master is killed and he's informed.

#### Initiation:

#### Return:


### Gameplay


#### Goals 

##### Overall:
- Find and punish those who killed Roarke's master using Roarke's skills as an enforcer, bodyguard and swordsman.

##### Short-Term: 
- Clear every level as efficiently and quickly as possible.
- Breather levels involve searching for evidence and speaking to witnesses, Roarke's allies, and others involved in the story. This will be the primary means i think of revealing more of the story. When a player is fighting, I want them focused on fighting.

#### Game Mechanics
##### The Stormsword (Roarke's Fighting Style)
- Primary means of attack is a dashing slash that passes through/by enemies while doing damage.

##### Arm Blaster
- Roarke's cybernetic arm can fire bolts of plasma at enemies in exchange for using Charge 

##### Perfect Storms
- When Roarke clears out an encounter in one flowing movement (no stopping, or without running out the combo timer), all of the enemies fall apart at the same time (think the Bride slicing up all those dudes in Kill Bill, then striking her blade to cease it's vibration and then everyone falls at the same time)
- I think this deserves a reward. This feeling right here is what all players of *Roarke* should seek. I want to encourage this behavior whenever possible.
- I'll think about what the reward for a Perfect Storm should be.

##### Level Timer (Maybe)
- I'm thinking i'll add a time limit to levels to further force urgency and momentum. Maybe Perfect Storms will extend that timer greatly, while just regular kills extend the timer just a bit.

#### Items and Power Ups
##### Items
- Mana bars for restoring Stamina (hehe i like this, mana infused protein bars)
- Medpacks for restoring Health
- Power cells for restoring Charge level of Roarke's cybernetics 

##### Power ups
- Mega Blaster: Power up that super charges Roarke's arm blaster for increased (double/triple/quad?) damage
- Storm God's Blessing: Temporarily gives Roarke unlimited Stamina
- War God's Blessing: Roarke's techniques do greatly increased damage

### Progression and Challenge


#### Losing 
- When you run out of health and die, you must start the entire level over. Players of *Roarke* are expected to seek perfection and will not be allowed to depend on checkpoints and save scumming.

- Running out of time: I want there to be a sense of urgency as players go through levels. Keep moving forward or risk failing your mission by allowing the culprits to escape.

- More of a presentation thing but still related: Thinking that when a player fails a level and returns to the beginning of a level, it'll be justified as 'Roarke was doing image training'. Screen after a game over is Roarke startling awake from a meditative stance, shaking his head and getting up. I kind of like that, just to keep some since of narrative consistency instead of just hand-waving 'it's a video game, you know what it is'. Seems more interesting to me and reveals more about Roarke's character.

### Technical Description


### Marketing & Funding


### Demographics

### Platforms & Monetization
- I guess Steam. But is that really necessary? Then again, I get all my games on Steam, but it's NOT where I actually hear about the games I buy.
- Definitely Windows/Mac/Linux.
- It'd be cool to port this to other systems if things go well, but that's thinking way too far ahead.

### Localization
- English. If this ends up being a success, then yeah, let's get some more languages going.

### Other Ideas
- Time attack mode?
- Survival mode (you vs a steadily increasing amount of mooks in a battle arena made for this mode)
