# Roarke Game Design Document

## Project Description
A hardcore tactical action game where the primary goal is to use Roarke's dashing slash to cut your way through levels as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## Characters
#### Roarke 'Windscar'
- The protagonist. A bodyguard/enforcer with a passion and talent for fencing and swordsmanship. 
- Born a half-orc in the Western Continent, he's made a name for himself for being mindful, strong, and skilled as a warrior and a bodyguard. He lives in a rough part of town (where most orcs live, due to functionally being lower class citizens and just generally out of their element compared to their brethren who were born and raised in their ancestral lands on the Eastern continent.) 
- He's one of the highest ranking students in his master's style, The Stormsword. Earned the title of 'Windscar' in his Adept exam.
- Lost his arm going above and beyond on a job and recieved an advanced cybernetic arm to replace it as thanks from his boss. Prefers wielding his sword with his natural arm to better channel his spiritual energy through it.
- Also a passionate student of philosophy and art. Despite being externally rough around the edges and hardened, he possesses hidden depths from growing up with a foot in both the world of humans and orcs, and developed complexes due to being alienated by both groups for being 'different'.

#### Harry 'Typhoon'
- Old, wise, and a full blown orc.
- Came to this continent with his family when he was a boy when the Homeland was embroiled in a full on civil war. 
- His parents believed the war and it's reasons for existing were dishonorable and so fled while there was still a chance.
- Took an interest in a young Roarke when he noticed the child had an imagination and an appreciation for art and aesthetics.
- Taught him the sword because he believed he'd do something good and beautiful with it.
- Earned the title 'Typhoon' when he ascended to Adept-class in the Stormsword-style, and held on to it instead of taking on a new name upon reaching Master-class. He says it was out of humility, to remember that he is but a student. In reality he just thought it made for a badass name. Everyone knows it but doesn't say anything. His humor and zest for life is appreciated by his students. 

#### Miranda IV
- A young, wealthy, elf lady.
- Roarke's boss. After hearing of his exploits in Sector O on the freelance circuit, and his incredible powers of perception, formidablee martial arts skills, and the surprisingly rare ability to hold a decent conversation, offered him full-time employment with salary and benefits. 
- During Roarke's first year on the job, he thwarted an attack on her life (more like a full blown assault), and lost his arm in the fight, but gained her respect and gratitude.
- Ruthless, with her hands in both legal and illegal enterprise
- Surprisingly enlightened. Has seen enough carnage and suffering to understand what binds all living beings.
- Because of her outlook and her pragmatism, she's formed a bond with Roarke despite his heritage due to his intelligence and skill having saved her life multiple times.
- Enjoys drinking with Roarke, and discussing fine art with him as he has viewpoint and an attention for detail that makes for good conversation.

#### The Orcs and Half-Orcs of 'O' Sector
#### Androids & Golems
#### Elves
#### Humans
#### Aliens (Intergalactic and Interdimensional)
#### Immortals (Gods, Old Ones, high level magical beings, Emperor-class AIs)


### Story 
Roarke's orcish swordmaster is murdered in what APPEARS to be a hate crime. 
Roarke is devastated and uses his skills as an enforcer to find the truth and avenge the master.
Becomes a folk hero and savior of O Sector in the process despite his inital reasons and motivation.
Almost singlehandedly changes perception of orcish in the eyes of the West through his actions and the movement he starts.
(I may make this more simple. I dunno.)

### Theme
- The Hero's Journey
- Striving for Excellence/Mastery/Perfection
- Flow
- Liberation (in the literal and spiritual sense)
- Acceptance (of self, and by society)
- The meaning of a Champion

### Story Progression
The game starts right in the action. 

#### Departure:
##### Introduction and Call To Adventure:
- Level 1: Same Shit, Different Day - Roarke is working a job for his client when a rival group of gangsters shows up and attacks the compound. Roarke puts them all down.
- Level 2: Windscar - Roarke practices his skills at his master's dojos against his fellow disciples in an all vs one battle. He's promoted to the next rank and is given the title, 'Windscar' to befit his new rank. That night, his Master is killed and he's informed.

*A sorrowful shower breaks out over Sector O*
*Game title "Roarke" appears on screen*

##### Refusal of the Call:
- Level 3: Grief - Roarke immerses himself further in his works. Asks for more work from his boss, who is amused and curious given what she knows about him. She obliges with a smile on her face, and sends him to punish a rival who has been disruptiing operations for months. Roarke attacks an enemy compound and wipes out a large group of enemies before being shot down and extracted by his fellow enforcers. 

##### Supernatural Aid
- Interlude - "Kill Em All, Roarke": Recovering from the battle...Roarke goes to a jazz club and gets drunk. Really drunk. Wallowing in his sorrow, Miranda corners him. 
"Get your shit together." They talk for a while, until he admits that he's hurting bad at the loss of his master. Miranda has to get him good and hammered and pry as kindly as she can to even get him to admit that. 
"So my friend...what do you want to do?"
"I want to find out why it happened, who did it, and fucking tear them limb from limb."
"My man. Well, don't let me hold you back. I'm giving you a non-negotiable vacation to go and handle your shit."
"What? What about..."
"I can take care of myself love. I could use a vacation myself anyway from all this fucked up shit. And to be honest, i've got a really bad feeling. May be connected to what happened to your master. So don't go thinking i've all of a sudden gone and grown a conscience. I need my champion back to 100%, so go, handle your shit."
Miranda opens a portal and pulls something out. It's a sword, with an elegant handle, and a silver sheath with clouds and lightning bolts tastefully etched into it. She hands it to Roarke.
"Take it. It's an elven longsword I had crafted for you. It just happened to be finished recently. Forged using a special metal, enchanted with wind and lightning magic to strengthen your Stormsword techniques, and vibrating nanomachines line the blade to increase it's cutting power. This thing is so badass, a man like you should be able to deflect bullets and energy blasts with it."
"!!!!"
Roarke stands up, draws it, swings it a few times, nods, and sheathes it. 
"Yeah, this will work."
"Kill em all Roarke."
"Obviously."

*Another storm starts. This one is a full blown thunderstorm. Raging and triumphant, like Zeus himself approves of Roarke's resolve. Lightning strikes across the City*

##### Crossing the First Threshold and the Belly of the Whale
- Level 4: Roarke goes to his master's house and breaks in...he investigates for a bit, and finds a secret room, that seems to have been made for one of his Adepts to find in case of his passing. Roarke discovers his master had been tracking and battling a conspiracy seeking to destroy Sector O to make room for new development and greatly weaken if not outright destroy the Orcish community in the City. A move that would likely affect Orcish life for the whole continent as many orcs take what they earn in the City and send it to their families or otherwise inspire others in the land. As Roarke takes his master's journal, he hears an explosion and smells smokes. His senses perk up and he feels the presence of assault mechs and golems in the building. He fights his way out of the burning building before it's completely demolished, along with the attached Dojo.
- Level 5: Shocked at the brazenness and cruelty of the conspiracy of he's discovered, Roarke resolves to keep following his Master's footsteps for the time being and understand what happened to him...no sooner does he think this to himself before he hears multiple explosions and looks out of his apartment view to see the slums of Sector O burning. Roarke feels a burning desire to help, and to see what happened and rushes to the area. It's bad. It's damn near nonsensical. A force of orcish mercenaries and androids are burning down tents and shacks and killing anyone that gets in their way. It's almost comically evil. Roarke feels his body get hot. Electric. The Storm fills Roarke's mind and body, and he rushes into the fray. Roarke slashes across the slums like a hurricane and kills all of the mercs and machines in an effort to protect the people from further loss of life and property. Covered in blood and oil, Roarke is shocked at his core by what's happening. Not the violence, he's done his share of dirt, but never at the expense of civilians and everyday people trying to get by. It's the raw suffering around him. The cruelty of the attack. A female orc rushes out and hugs him and thanks him crying. He's never been thanked like this before. Especially for wiping out a small army. It feels good. Roarke has a lot to think about after this.

#### Initiation:

#### Return:


### Gameplay


#### Goals 

##### Overall:
- Find and punish those who killed Roarke's master using Roarke's skills as an enforcer, bodyguard and swordsman.

##### Short-Term: 
- Clear every level as efficiently and quickly as possible.
- Breather levels involve searching for evidence and speaking to witnesses, Roarke's allies, and others involved in the story. This will be the primary means i think of revealing more of the story. When a player is fighting, I want them focused on fighting.


#### User Skills
- PATIENCE
- Determination
- Resilience
- Quick Reflexes
- Decisiveness
- Comfort with/or willingness to learn to play with either a modern controller, or with mouse/keyboard
- Resource management
- Situational awareness
- Timing, rhythm


#### Game Mechanics
##### The Stormsword (Roarke's Fighting Style)
- Lightning Strike: Primary means of attack - a dashing slash that passes through/by enemies while doing damage. Costs one point of stamina.
- Hurricane Strike: Roake does a double distance dash strike. Costs two points of stamina.
- Delta Strike: Roarke dashes around an area in a triangle shape. If the lines connect into a proper triangle, everything within will take heavy damage. Has to be invoked manually by actually using 
- Bermuda Triangle: If the situation is set up for it. Roarke can create a double sized Delta Strike using three Tornado Slashes and wipe out anything the triangle. I only want this to happen twice, or three times in the game. Twice while he's still 'Windscar', and once when he's become 'Starslasher'. Likely will force it to happen once to clear a stage, the other times will be as a challenge to the player and the only way to invoke a Perfect Storm in pivotal moments of the game. 
- Void Slash/Solar Flare: Roarke uses all of his stamina to send out a sweeping wave projectile that deals medium ('Void Slash') or heavy ('Solar Flare'). This literally Roarke just letting loose a Windscar like from Inuyasha lololol.

##### Arm Blaster
- Roarke's cybernetic arm can fire bolts of plasma at enemies in exchange for using Charge 
- After Roarke gains the Star God's Blessing, Roarke can use all 3 points of Charge to fire a heavy damage beam that penetrates across the screen. 

##### Perfect Storms
- When Roarke clears out an encounter in one flowing movement (no stopping, or without running out the combo timer), all of the enemies fall apart at the same time (think the Bride slicing up all those dudes in Kill Bill, then striking her blade to cease it's vibration and then everyone falls at the same time)
- I think this deserves a reward. This feeling right here is what all players of *Roarke* should seek. I want to encourage this behavior whenever possible.
- I'll think about what the reward for a Perfect Storm should be.

##### Roarke 'Solarstorm'/'Starslasher'/'Starstorm' (This is just theorycrafting)
- The final chapters of the game will see Roarke adopting a new title to go along with a newly acquired power. The elves' God of Stars blesses Roarke at the behest of Miranda, and grants him access to the Solar element and a starsaber.
- In terms of gameplay, i've got a few ideas for how i want this to be reflected:
- 1. Roarke's dash attack animation changes and the speed of the attacks increases greatly. He turns into a beam of light and passes through the enemy and reforms.
- 2. He gains the ability to do this without rest or cost to his stamina. Meaning, a player can use the basic dash attack infinite times without fear of exhaustion. Not only that, but if a user desires (maybe during the further distance slashes) they can cancel and change directions.
- 3. Roarke's sprite changes. It has a star-like radiance, glowing eyes, and clutching a light sword.
- 4. I'll give the user a space/playground inside Roarke's visualization space to get acclimated to the change. As I intend to really turn things up to 11 once I give them this power.
- 5. Roarke is basically a Gold Saint at this point. I'm totally ok with that.
- 6. To adjust for Roarke's new power and technical efficiency, there will be more situations that require Advanced Techniques (Double/Triple distance strikes, Delta Strikes, Solar Flares) 
- 7. Unlocks a power shot for his arm blaster



##### Level Timer (Maybe)
- I'm thinking i'll add a time limit to levels to further force urgency and momentum. Maybe Perfect Storms will extend that timer greatly, while just regular kills extend the timer just a bit.

#### Items and Power Ups
##### Items
- Mana bars for restoring Stamina (hehe i like this, mana infused protein bars)
- Medpacks for restoring Health
- Power cells for restoring Charge level of Roarke's cybernetics 

##### Power ups
- Mega Blaster: Power up that super charges Roarke's arm blaster for increased (double/triple/quad?) damage
- Storm God's Blessing: Temporarily gives Roarke unlimited Stamina
- War God's Blessing: Roarke's techniques do greatly increased damage
- Star God's Blessing: This is permanent. Roarke's damage increases, basic dash attacks don't use Stamina. Attacks take on a burning plasma/light motif as opposed to lightning.

### Progression and Challenge


#### Losing 
- When you run out of health and die, you must start the entire level over. Players of *Roarke* are expected to seek perfection and will not be allowed to depend on checkpoints and save scumming.

- Running out of time: I want there to be a sense of urgency as players go through levels. Keep moving forward or risk failing your mission by allowing the culprits to escape.

- More of a presentation thing but still related: Thinking that when a player fails a level and returns to the beginning of a level, it'll be justified as 'Roarke was doing image training'. Screen after a game over is Roarke startling awake from a meditative stance, shaking his head and getting up. I kind of like that, just to keep some since of narrative consistency instead of just hand-waving 'it's a video game, you know what it is'. Seems more interesting to me and reveals more about Roarke's character. 

### Music and Sounds 
#### Music
- Rock
- Jazz
- EDM
- Soul
- Hip hop (A bit trappy?)
- Consult Christophe

#### Sounds
- I want it to sound good? 
- Again, consult Christophe.


### Technical Description


### Marketing & Funding
- Reddit
- Kotaku
- Twitch
- Youtube

#### Funding
- I don't REALLY want to try to fund it. Though, I dunno...given that this whole project is an experiment in getting a feel for the game development process, it'd be really fascinating to try and raise some money via Kickstarter to refine the game once i've got the concepts locked in. 

### Demographics
- Basically, dudes/ladies like me who like indie games that will challenge their reflexes and determination.
- People who like action games
- People who like science-fantasy settings?

### Platforms & Monetization
- I guess Steam. But is that really necessary? Then again, I get all my games on Steam, but it's NOT where I actually hear about the games I buy.
- Definitely Windows/Mac/Linux.
- It'd be cool to port this to other systems if things go well, but that's thinking way too far ahead.

### Localization
- English. If this ends up being a success, then yeah, let's get some more languages going.

### Other Ideas
- Time attack mode?
- Survival mode (you vs a steadily increasing amount of mooks in a battle arena made for this mode)
