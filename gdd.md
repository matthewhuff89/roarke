##### Roarke Game Design Document

### Project Description
A hardcore tactical action game where the primary goal is to use Roarke's dashing slash to cut your way through levels as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## Characters
#### Roarke 
- The protagonist. A bodyguard/enforcer with a passion and talent for fencing and swordsmanship. 
- Born a half-orc in the Western Continent, he's made a name for himself for being mindful, strong, and skilled as a warrior and a bodyguard. He lives in a rough part of town (where most orcs live, due to functionally being lower class citizens and just generally out of their element compared to their brethren who were born and raised in their ancestral lands on the Eastern continent.) 
- He's one of the highest ranking students in his master's style, The Stormsword.
- Lost his arm going above and beyond on a job and recieved an advanced cybernetic arm to replace it as thanks from his client.
- Also a passionate student of philosophy and art. Despite being externally rough around the edges and hardened, he possesses hidden depths from growing up with a foot in both the world of humans and orcs, and developed complexes due to being alienated by both groups for being 'different'.

#### Roarke's Master (To be named)

### Story 
Roarke's orcish swordmaster is murdered in what APPEARS to be a hate crime. 
Roarke is devastated and uses his skills as an enforcer to find the truth and avenge the master.
Becomes a folk hero and savior of O Sector in the process despite his inital reasons and motivation.
Almost singlehandedly changes perception of orcish in the eyes of the West through his actions and the movement he starts.
(I may make this more simple. I dunno.)

### Theme

### Story Progression


### Gameplay


#### Goals 

##### Overall:
- Find and punish those who killed Roarke's master using Roarke's skills as an enforcer, bodyguard and swordsman.

##### Short-Term: 
- Clear every level as efficiently and quickly as possible.
- Breather levels involve searching for evidence and speaking to witnesses, Roarke's allies, and others involved in the story. This will be the primary means i think of revealing more of the story. When a player is fighting, I want them focused on fighting.

Timing, rhythm


#### Game Mechanics
##### The Stormsword (Roarke's Fighting Style)
- Primary means of attack is a dashing slash that passes through/by enemies while doing damage.

##### Arm Blaster
- Roarke's cybernetic arm can fire bolts of plasma at enemies in exchange for using Charge 

##### Perfect Storms
- When Roarke clears out an encounter in one flowing movement (no stopping, or without running out the combo timer), all of the enemies fall apart at the same time (think the Bride slicing up all those dudes in Kill Bill, then striking her blade to cease it's vibration and then everyone falls at the same time)
- I think this deserves a reward. This feeling right here is what all players of *Roarke* should seek. I want to encourage this behavior whenever possible.
- I'll think about what the reward for a Perfect Storm should be.

##### Level Timer (Maybe)
- I'm thinking i'll add a time limit to levels to further force urgency and momentum. Maybe Perfect Storms will extend that timer greatly, while just regular kills extend the timer just a bit.

#### Items and Power Ups
##### Items
- Mana bars for restoring Stamina (hehe i like this, mana infused protein bars)
- Medpacks for restoring Health
- Power cells for restoring Charge level of Roarke's cybernetics 

##### Power ups
- Mega Blaster: Power up that super charges Roarke's arm blaster for increased (double/triple/quad?) damage
- Storm God's Blessing: Temporarily gives Roarke unlimited Stamina
- War God's Blessing: Roarke's techniques do greatly increased damage

### Progression and Challenge


#### Losing 
- When you run out of health and die, you must start the entire level over. Players of *Roarke* are expected to seek perfection and will not be allowed to depend on checkpoints and save scumming.

- Running out of time: I want there to be a sense of urgency as players go through levels. Keep moving forward or risk failing your mission by allowing the culprits to escape.
